- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ernhollam
- ðŸ§¶ Iâ€™m interested in crochet, team sports but also coding. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to code in Java. I've learnt it during my college years when I was attending my engineering school but I've worked only with Matlab during my 5+ years experience in the automotive industry and aeronotics.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me : You can find me here or on LinkedIn, I usually answer within one day.
- ðŸ‘€ Here's an overview of the projects in the OpenClassrooms "Java backend developer" path:
