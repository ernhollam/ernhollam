# Hi, Iâ€™m Ernholla!
- ðŸ§¶ Iâ€™m interested in crochet, team sports but also coding.
- ðŸŒ± I attented an Engineering school in Nancy (France) and majored in automated embedded systems engineering.
I worked with Matlab during my 5+ years experience in the automotive industry and aeronotics.  
After the Covid crisis, I did an apprenticeship from September 2021 to September 2023 to learn how to code web applications with Java.
- :sparkles: Here's an overview of my favorite project from the OpenClassrooms "Java backend developer" path:  
  Design a database from scratch, generate the database schema, implement UML diagramm, use pattern repository and create html templates using Thymeleaf â”€ https://github.com/ernhollam/PayMyBuddy
- :bomb: After the my apprenticeship at Lomaco (Figeac), I found a new position at APEX Solutions where we are building tools in Python/C++ to study the effects of blasts in urban areas.
- :computer: I'm still developping tools in Python or Java for my personnal use.
- :mailbox_with_mail: How to reach me : You can find me on LinkedIn, I usually answer within one day.
