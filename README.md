# Hi, I’m Ernholla!
- 🧶 I’m interested in crochet, team sports but also coding.
- 🌱 I attented the [ENSEM](https://ensem.univ-lorraine.fr/en/home/), an engineering school (Nancy, France) where majored in automated embedded systems engineering.
I worked with Matlab during my 5+ years experience in the automotive industry as well as aeronotics.  
- 😷 After the Covid crisis, I did an apprenticeship from September 2021 to September 2023 to learn how to code web applications with Java. You can find my favorite project from the OpenClassrooms "Java backend developer" path [here](https://github.com/ernhollam/PayMyBuddy)
- 💣 After my apprenticeship at Lomaco (Figeac, France), I found a new position at [APEX Solutions](https://apex-solutions.fr/) (Cambes - 46, France) where we are building tools in Python/C++ to study the effects of blasts in urban areas. I'm currently developping GUI to show the effects of a blast in an urban area (danger zones, lethality probability, collapse risk, etc.)
- 💻 I'm still developping tools in Python or Java for my personnal use.
- 📬 How to reach me : You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/ernhollam), I usually answer within one day.
