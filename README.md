- 👋 Hi, I’m @ernhollam
- 👀 I’m interested in crochet, team sports but also coding. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code in Java. I've learnt it during my college years when I was attending my engineering school but I've worked only with Matlab in my work experience.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web apps, but I'm still new to all of this. I hope I'll be competent as soon as possible.
- 📫 How to reach me : You can find me here or on LinkedIn, I usually answer within one day.
